                    <p>Guardiola‘s ascent from Barcelona B Head Coach to UEFA Champions League winner took place against a footballing backdrop very different to the one he has created since joining City.</p>
                    <p>Following an era where the moment of transition between defence and attack had been pinpointed as the single most decisive action in a match, allowing pragmatic, counter-attacking football to prosper, Guardiola showed that there was another way.</p>
                    <p>He won the La Liga title in three of his four seasons at the Camp Nou and lifted the UEFA Champions League twice. In addition, the Catalan giants won the Supercopa de Espana three times, as well as twice lifting the Copa del Rey, the UEFA Super Cup and the FIFA Club World Cup.</p>
                    <p>There were eyebrows raised when he decided to take over at Bayern Munich in 2013, particularly as they had just won the Champions League and domestic treble.</p> 
                    <p>Could Pep do it without Messi? Without Iniesta, Xavi and Busquets? Without his mother tongue? In another culture? In another league? How do you take over a treble-winning Bayern Munich side at the peak of its powers?</p>

                    <div id="hidden_bio">
                        <p>A new manager in a new country with an unfamiliar group of players who’ve won it all – far from a task of merely keeping the Bavarian juggernaut on track, Guardiola set about taking the players he had to the next level.</p>
                        <p>He made just one signing in his first transfer window, subverting the footballing trope that a manager must build from a position of strength. Pep absorbed the best of the footballing institution that is Bayern and blended it with his own innovative tactical ideas to produce some of the best football that Germany has ever seen.</p>
                        <p>He improved his players. Champions League and World Cup-winning players. He taught them to play new positions, showed them another way to win as a collective and they loved him for it.</p>
                        <p>Seeing off the threat of Borussia Dortmund, Pep led his all-conquering Bayern to the last four of the UEFA Champions League in each of his three seasons, landing the Bundesliga three times and winning the league and cup double twice.</p>
                        <p>Guardiola made a stunning start to life at City, winning his first 11 games in charge and was twice nominated for the Premier League Manager of the Month award in August and September 2016.</p>
                        <p>In his second season he guided the Blues to the Premier League title and the Carabao Cup, smashing records along the way in a stunning season. He picked up four successive Manager of the Month awards and was voted the Premier League Manager of the Season and the LMA Manager of the Year.</p>
                        <p>He was again voted Premier League manager of the year after guiding City to four more trophies in 2018/19 to become the Club’s most successful boss ever with six trophies in three seasons.</p>
                        <p>City added the Carabao Cup and Community Shield to Pep’s list in 2019/20, but the Catalan won yet more silverware in 2020/21, with another Premier League title and Carabao Cup success.</p>
                        <p>He also became the first City boss to take his side to a Champions League final in May 2021, taking his trophy haul to 10.</p>
                        <p>​Guardiola‘s incredible spell at the Etihad saw him claim a fourth Premier League title in five years in 2021/22 as well as reaching the Champions League semi-final.</p>
                        <p>The Catalan then signed a new two-year contract extension with the Club in November of 2022, a deal that will take him through to the summer of 2025.</p>
                        <p>He reached another impressive milestone in April 2023, claiming a 100th home Premier League win in record time when City beat Liverpool 4-1 at the Etihad Stadium.</p>
                        <p>Our winning form has continued for the remainder of the season under Guardiola‘s leadership, helping City lift our third consecutive Premier League title with three games remaining of the 2022/23 campaign.</p>
                        <p>And to top off another history-defining season under Peps tenure, our FA Cup final win over Manchester United followed by our Champions League final win over Inter saw us named Treble winners.</p>
                        <p>The manager continues to take us to new heights as he led the Club to our first ever Super Cup victory in our debut appearance in the European showpiece. Cole Palmer‘s equaliser to make it 1-1 against Europa League champions Sevilla sent the game to penalties in which Guardiola‘s side came out victorious.</p>
                        <p>Pep also won his fourth FIFA Club World Cup in December 2023 as City beat Fluminense 4-0 in Jeddah.</p>
