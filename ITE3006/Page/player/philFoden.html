                    <p>Widely regarded as one of England’s most gifted players, lifelong Blue Phil Foden excelled at youth level before graduating into the first-team. </p>
                    <p>The Stockport-born playmaker joined City at Under-9 level now.</p>
                    <p>A creative, left-footed midfielder, Foden allies his eye for a pass with an ability to glide past opponents, something which stood out during his time in the Academy.</p>
                    <p>He was an FA Youth Cup final runner-up in 2016/17, scoring in the first leg of the final as City lost to Chelsea. He also found the net 11 times in the Under-18 Premier League that season.</p>
                    <p>His form prompted Pep Guardiola to include him in his squad for the Champions League tie against Celtic in December 2016.</p>
                    <p>The following summer Foden made the England Under-17 squad for the European Championships and scored in the final, where the Young Lions lost to Spain on penalties, but he returned to City for pre-season and was included in the first-team tour of the United States.</p>

                    </div>
                    <div id="hidden_bio">
                        <p>He produced several impressive displays and made several matchday squads in the early part of the 2017/18 season before departing for the Under-17 World Cup in India.</p>
                        <p>England won the tournament and Foden was instrumental, scoring twice in the final and scooping the Golden Ball prize for the tournament’s best player.</p>
                        <p>Returning to Manchester, he was handed his senior debut against Feyenoord in the Champions League in November 2017. Replacing Yaya Toure in the 75th minute, he became the youngest City player to play in a European competition.</p>
                        <p>A month later he became the youngest Englishman to start in a Champions League game when he was named in the starting XI against Shakhtar Donetsk and his Premier League debut followed 10 days later.</p>
                        <p>He made several cameos as City lifted the 2017/18 Premier League title and signed a new deal in December 2018, which keeps him at the Club until 2024.</p>
                        <p>In the 2018/19 campaign, he saw more game time, scoring seven goals in 26 appearances as City swept all before them in English football.</p>
                        <p>Foden continued to go from strength to strength last term, winning the man of the match award in our 2020 Carabao Cup final win over Aston Villa and making 38 appearances in total, scoring eight goals.</p>
                        <p>He was then awarded his first England cap in September 2020, but his impact at club level continued to grow.</p>
                        <p>Foden was a key first team member, with his thrilling array skills earning him 50 appearances in 2020/21 and 16 goals.</p>
                        <p>He was voted the PFA Young Player of the Year for his efforts during a stunning campaign.</p>
                        <p>And he kicked on again in 2021/22, adding another 45 appearances and scoring 14 goals to leave him just five short of a half-century.</p>
                        <p>Foden‘s energy and trickery are a key part of Pep Guardiola‘s attacking philosophy and his performances won him a second successive Young Premier League Player of the Season. By the end of the 2021/22 campaign, Foden had also won 15 England caps.</p>
                        <p>Foden marked the early part of the 2022/23 by signing a new long-term contract, committing him to City through to the summer of 2027.</p>
                        <p>The then 22-year-old was one of five City players named in the England squad for the 2022 World Cup finals.</p>
                        <p>And he made a big impression out in Qatar, making four appearances, starting three times and scoring against Wales, to help England reach the quarter-finals.</p>
                        <p>The midfielder marked his 200th senior City appearance with a goal and assist against Bournemouth in February 2023.</p>
                        <p>Foden became the youngest player to reach 50 Premier League goal involvements for City in the 2-0 victory over Newcastle United in March 2023.</p>
                        <p>His opener against the Magpies took him to 33 goals and 17 assists at the tender age of just 22 years and 280 days.</p>
                        <p>He’s top of an impressive list, beating Gabriel Jesus into second, with the former striker hitting the 50 mark in the 2-2 home draw with Crystal Palace on 18 January 2020 at 22 years and 290 days.</p>
                        <p>And in May, Foden helped City secure their third consecutive Premier League title and the seventh FA Cup in the Club’s history in June.</p>
                        <p>He also featured as a first half substitute in our Champions League final win over Inter to be part of the Treble-winning team that made history.</p>
                        <p>In the start of the 2023/24 season, Foden was an instrumental figure in City’s Super Cup win over Sevilla. </p>
                        <p>He played the entirety of the match which ended 1-1 after 90 minutes before Guardiola‘s side won the European showpiece on penalties. </p>
                        <p>Foden added to his huge collection of winner’s medals with City after the 4-0 FIFA Club World win over Fluminense in December 2023 - scoring the third goal of the evening.</p>
