                    <p>A product of Barnsley’s academy, John Stones built a reputation of an assured ball-playing centre-half with Everton before signing for City in August 2016.</p>
                    <p>Already an England international, the defender penned a six-year deal to become the eighth arrival of the summer 2016 transfer window and since then, has won every domestic honour available.</p>
                    <p>Stones rose through the ranks of his home town club, making his Barnsley debut against Reading in March 2011, the first of 28 appearances for the Tykes.</p> 
                    <p>Having displayed a maturity beyond his years, he was promptly snapped up by Everton on the final day of the January 2013 transfer window.</p> 
                    <p>He was made to wait until the following season for his debut, but his role in the team grew with time and he went on to make 95 senior appearances in three seasons, netting his first goal in 3-0 win over Manchester United in April 2015.</p>
                    <p>His reputation was growing and City swooped, with Pep Guardiola an admirer of Stones’ ability to both neutralise the opposition and launch attacks of his own with his range of passing.</p>

                    <div id="readmore_button" onclick="showBio();">
                        Read More
                    </div>
                    <div id="hidden_bio">
                        <p>A solid first season saw Stones make 41 appearances and he started his second campaign in superb form, netting twice against Feyenoord in the Champions League, before injury against Leicester disrupted his progress.</p>
                        <p>Nevertheless, he turned out 29 times to help City lift the 2017/18 Premier League and Carabao Cup – his first taste of success at senior level – and won a place in England’s 2018 World Cup squad.</p>
                        <p>Injury again affected Stones’ 2018/19 season, though he remained an important figure within the team, featuring in 39 games.</p>
                        <p>Now considered first choice by Gareth Southgate, Stones made his international debut under Roy Hodgson, in the 3-0 friendly win over Peru in May 2014.</p>
                        <p>He was included in the Euro 2016 squad, but didn’t see any playing time, meaning his major tournament debut came at the 2018 World Cup.</p>
                        <p>Injuries restricted Stones to just 24 appearances in 2019/20 but the 2020/21 season proved to be a memorable one for the former Barnsley and Everton star.</p> 
                        <p>Stones‘ form and partnership wit new signing Ruben Dias formed the backbone of City superb mid-season run of victories that took the Blues to the summit of the Premier League.</p>
                        <p>Having rediscovered his best form, he played 35 times for City and scored five goals as well as winning his England place back for Euro 2020.</p> 
                        <p>Stones re-established himself as one of the best defenders in Europe and only injury set-backs prevented him from playing more than he did in 2021/22. He made 27 appearances, but made some telling contributions when he did play.</p>
                        <p>Stones has also demonstrated his defensive versatility so far during the 2022/23 campaign, performing with great distinction at right back as well in the centre of defence.</p>
                        <p>And he was also one of five City players named in the England squad for the 2022 World Cup finals. Stones enjoyed a fine tournament out in Qatar, making five starting appearances to help England reach the quarter-finals before they were edged out 2-1 by France.</p>
                        <p>His versatility to play in both City’s defensive and midfield lines have included stand-out performances in the business end of the season.</p>
                        <p>Stones scored in our 4-1 win over Arsenal, one of 10 consecutive wins for City when Stones has taken to the pitch, which helped us win our third consecutive Premier League title.</p> 
                        <p>The England international had a stand-out performance in City’s 2-1 win over Manchester United in the FA Cup final to win his first trophy of the competition.</p> <p>Stones played the majority of our 1-0 win over Inter in the Champions League final to help City win our first-ever Treble.</p>
                        <p>Extending our silverware success into the beginning of the 2023/24 season, Stones was part of the squad who beat Sevilla on penalties to win the UEFA Super Cup for the first time in the Club’s history.</p>
                        <p>Stones was also part of the City squad who claimed the FIFA Club World Cup in December 2023.</p>
