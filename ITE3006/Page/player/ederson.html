                    <p>Ederson arrived at City on 1 July 2017 with a reputation as one of the brightest young goalkeeping prospects in world football.</p>
                    <p>Born Ederson Santana de Moraes, he began his youth career in his native Brazil with São Paulo FC, before venturing into Europe aged 16 to sign with Benfica. It was in Portugal where his professional career began, initially with second-tier outfit Ribeirão, where his form earned him a move to Primeira Liga side, Rio Ave.</p>
                    <p>During a three year stay, he played 63 games in all competitions and enhanced his reputation so much so that Benfica brought him back to the Stadium of Light in 2015. Ederson’s second spell in Lisbon began in the B team, as understudy to Brazil’s first choice ‘keeper, Julio Cesar, but he succeeded his compatriot in the 2016/17 campaign and helped the Eagles to a league and cup double.</p>
                    <p>With a habit of producing excellent reflex saves and boasting outstanding distribution, Pep Guardiola swooped for the then 23-year-old in the summer of 2017.</p>
                    <p>He agreed a six-year contract and three months later, in October 2017, made his senior debut for Brazil, keeping a clean sheet in a 3-0 World Cup qualifying win over Chile.</p>

                    <div id="hidden_bio">
                        <p>Ederson enjoyed a fantastic first campaign with City, keeping 16 clean sheets as an integral part of the Club’s Premier League success.</p>
                        <p>His form earned him a PFA Young Player of the Year nomination and saw him selected in Brazil’s 2018 World Cup squad.</p>
                        <p>In May 2018, he penned a new deal with City that tied him to the Club until 2025 and impressed again in 2018/19.</p>
                        <p>Twenty clean sheets saw him named in the PFA Team of the Year, whilst he also saved a penalty in the shootout as City beat Chelsea to lift the Carabao Cup.</p> 
                        <p>Ederson’s fantastic footwork, including the sheer distance of some his kicks, has generated much admiration at the Etihad Stadium and in May 2018 he broke the Guinness World Record for the longest drop kick, registering 75.35 metres.</p> 
                        <p>Ederson is without doubt a pioneer for the Premier League. Since his arrival, the majority of keepers in this country have changed the way they play, with the emphasis on playing from the back now commonplace for many teams in England. That means technique, control and distribution are all key elements for any top goalkeeper - though outstanding reflexes, agility and the ability to command the penalty area remain crucial.</p>
                        <p>Ederson won the 2019/20 Golden Glove award for the most Premier League clean sheets.</p>
                        <p>He was again a crucial member of the City side that won the 2020/21 Premier League title and Carabao Cup. He made 47 starts in all competitions and again won the Golden Glove award for most Premier League shut-outs.</p>
                        <p>Regarded as one of the best goalkeepers not only in the Premier League, but in the world, the talented and intelligent Ederson is integral to Pep Guardiola‘s City.</p> 
                        <p>Ederson again won the Golden Glove in 2021/22, sharing the award with Alisson Becker of Liverpool with 20 shutouts.</p>
                        <p>Ederson made a fine start to the 2022/23 campaign, and was also part of the Brazil squad at the 2022 World Cup finals in Qatar.</p>
                        <p>Our No.31, courtesy of a shut-out in March 2023’s 2-0 victory over Newcastle United, became the 17th goalkeeper in the Premier League to reach 100 clean sheets. But, vitally, by achieving it in just 208 games, he became the third quickest to that landmark. Ahead of him are experienced duo Petr Cech at No.1 and Pepe Reina at No.2, who achieved the feat in 180 and 198 games respectively.</p>
                        <p>Ederson has continued to be a pivotal voice in City’s defensive system for the latter end of the 2022/23 campaign, helping us secure our third consecutive Premier League title. And the Brazilian was in the squad which was crowned 2023 FA Cup winners in June 2023. And to say he played an integral role in our Champions League final win is an understatement.</p>
                        <p>Ederson made numerous late-stage saves to deny Inter an equaliser as City grasped onto their 1-0 win to secure the Treble and the Club’s first Champions League trophy.</p>
                        <p>In August 2023, Ederson was relied on heavily again in our debut appearance in the UEFA Super Cup.</p><p>The Brazilian pulled off a handful of vital saves to deny our opponents Sevilla of a decisive goal, sending the match to penalties after drawing 1-1 in 90 minutes. He was able to do enough between the sticks to help City beat the Europa League champions and lift the European showpiece for the first time in the Club’s history.</p>
                        <p>Ederson also kept a clean sheet in the FIFA Club World Cup win over Fluminense in December 2023.</p>
